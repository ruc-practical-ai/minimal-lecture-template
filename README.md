# Minimal Lecture Template
Template for lecture notes with minimal memory usage and dependencies.

## Installation and Usage

### Installation and Use via Github Codespaces (Recommended)

To use this repository via codespaces simply click on the `code` &rarr; `codespaces` &rarr; `create codespace on main` buttons.

Once the codespace is open in the browser, click the three bars in the top left corner and select `Open in VS Code Desktop`.

Widgets might work better when using VS Code Desktop vs. in the browser.

If required, use `Cmd` / `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` &rarr; `Codespaces: Rebuild Container` to rebuild the container. Do not use `gh codespace rebuild`. This takes a long time since it re-downloads the entire image.
